      "Far from being an afterthought or simply something to dip chips in, condiments are currently experiencing a renaissance, especially in the fine food world.  \n",
      "As Rick Sheepshanks, founder of Stokes Sauces, explains, “We have always believed condiments are more than a dollop, spoon or squeeze on the side of the plate. Consumers are encouraged to add depth to gravy, richness to casseroles; to include, stir and a whisk to make ordinary food extraordinary on the plate.” \n",
      "This is something Maria Whitehead, director of Hawkshead Relish, strongly believes. “Condiments are there to enhance the dining experience and not to take over the main event, so they should be paired to add layers of flavour to a dish or meal and elevate the experience.  \n",
      "“Sauces, in particular, have really come to the forefront in the last few years. They’re so easy to use, and versatile. Adding a touch of our Spiced Mango Ketchup, for example, to a curry makes a world of difference, bringing extra layers of complexity and zing.” \n",
      "One dedicated advocate of the importance of condiments is Laura Roberts, owner of Laura’s Larder in Orpington. “They make up about 90% of my fridge and shelf space at home, much to the annoyance of members of my household who are constantly trying to find space for fruit or yoghurt or cereal, but they really do make a meal sing,” she tells Speciality Food. “They are also perfect for the time poor and the snacker, guilty of it all.” The sustainability factor\n",
      "With sustainability a huge consideration for consumers, condiments are the perfect stock to uplift meals and help prevent food waste, while often being sustainable themselves.  \n",
      "As Athena Lee, marketing manager at ShelfNow, explains, “One of the most effective ways to reduce food waste is by using up the ingredients we already have. By incorporating condiments, we can revive and repurpose leftovers, creating entirely new and exciting flavours. Condiments can transform fridge leftovers into a delicious reinvention, ensuring that no food goes to waste.” \n",
      "With cost-conscious consumers looking for ways to make their money go further, condiments are certainly must-stocks for fine food retailers. \n",
      "According to Becky Vale, marketing director at Tracklements, “Condiments are by their very nature heroes of reducing food waste as their heritage lies in preserving the glut of the seasons. This is a tradition Tracklements is keen to continue and one of the reasons we make our ever-popular special editions, our Aromatic Medlar Jelly and our English Crabapple Jelly.  \n",
      "“More than that, condiments are the secret weapon of the larder, combatting waste wherever they’re found by generously transforming simple dishes into sumptuous feasts and adding a swell of intense flavour to everything they accompany. They are the vivacious and big-hearted guest at the table, as at home on the side of a plate of cold meats or cheese as they are adding depth to a stew.” \n",
      "Another brand that believes this is Hawkshead Relish. “There are so many more uses for condiments, that we wrote a book called Embellish with Relish, packed with recipes which use our condiments as ingredients. It can be as simple as coating a salmon steak with Black Garlic Ketchup and rolling in sesame seeds, before roasting in the oven for a quick, simple and very tasty midweek supper.” Going international\n",
      "While traditional British favourites continue to dominate sales according to ShelfNow, ever since the pandemic changed the way consumers could explore different cuisines, international flavours have seen a boom. \n",
      "“There has been an evident surge in the popularity of global flavours,” Athena explains. “Our data reveals that Indian and Italian-inspired condiments have captured a significant portion of the market, accounting for around 50% of all condiment sales. Additionally, the demand for East Asian flavours has experienced remarkable growth in the past two years.” \n",
      "As Becky says, “There’s a real sense of exploration with food at the moment, driven by social media and the need for adventure. We’re seeing a willingness to experiment and try different combinations, although this takes the form of people combining known flavours themselves rather than necessarily wanting to be presented with obscure flavours.  \n",
      "“In condiments particularly, it’s more about using established products in new and different ways rather than adopting unfamiliar new flavours.” \n",
      "One fine food retailer who has certainly experienced this desire to experiment is Laura’s Larder. “In store we’ve seen a real boost in international flavours with globally inspired condiments, sauces, oils, and seasonings bringing life to everyday meals,” Laura tells Speciality Food. \n",
      "“We’ve been enjoying a wave of texture and flavour offering complex blends of herbs, spice, speciality chillies, fruit, nuts, seeds and punches of umami. Think Japanese crispy chilli oil, Mexican salsa macha, West African shito sauce, Spanish romesco, Indian achaar, Filipino adobo and more.” \n",
      "One key way to encourage hesitant customers to steer away from their classic mayo or pesto sauces is to use exciting combinations on your in-store menu. As Laura explains, “We’ve been pimping our sandwiches at least once a week — taking inspiration from the Chinese rou jia mo, the Argentine choripán, and the South Asian paratha in our daily specials, really helping to showcase the products we sell. We find leaving one by the till with a ‘try me in today’s special’ sign really helps to boost sales.” \n",
      "Trend spotlight: Turning up the heat \n",
      "Tying into the ‘Swicy’ trend that marries sweet and spicy flavours, hot sauces are certainly enjoying a moment. Indeed, research from Tracklements revealed that 53% of shoppers are buying hot sauces at least every three months.  \n",
      "Laura Roberts agrees, “The spicy trend certainly isn’t going anywhere, is it? Considering all the pressures of daily life and knowing that spicy products can give you a quick release from stress with dopamine – then perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised. Everyone loves a hot sauce!” \n",
      "What makes the trend so significant is that it ties in well with the desire for international flavours. As Laura explains, “Some brands seem to have just nailed both the ‘hot’ and ‘international’ trends. We, and many others, love Bombom’s full range; the Gochujang, Kimchi Mayo and Ssamjang are wonderful to dip, dunk and marinate. And if you haven’t seen Conbini’s gorgeous-looking Japanese inspired sauces then check them out.” Three brands to watch\n",
      "Athena Lee, marketing manager at digital wholesaler ShelfNow, shares three best-selling sauces that hit the trends for fine food retailers.\n",
      "• Pico Sauces Punjabi Ketchup: Pico Sauces offers a range of hot sauces, chutneys, and ketchup that perfectly capture the authentic flavours of Modern India. British customers are captivated by these condiments, as they deliver a unique and delightful taste experience. The thoughtfully packaged products beautifully showcase the vibrant and diverse flavours of Indian cuisine, allowing customers to explore and incorporate exciting tastes into their meals. \n",
      "• 2 Fingers Chunky Tartare Sauce: The condiments from the 2 Fingers range have gained significant popularity, thanks to their artisanal approach and global flavour inspiration. Crafted in small batches in West London, these chunky sauces are created with free-range egg mayonnaise, fresh herbs, and absolutely no artificial sweeteners, colours, or flavours.\n",
      "• Longbottom & Co. Hot Sauce: This exceptional hot sauce is tomato and pepper-based, infused with ingredients like scotch bonnet chillies, red pepper, and tomatoes.

      "Hot Sauce Market Trends: How Gen Z is Redefining Hot Sauce Culture\n",
      "Hot sauce can be a polarizing topic: some can’t eat it while others can’t go without it – to the point where they even bring it to restaurants. Among hot sauce enthusiasts, this topping is more than a condiment, it’s a culture. \n",
      "As Americans make homemade hot sauce, test the limits of their taste buds, and try artisanal hot sauce, one generation seems to be fueling this trend: Gen Z. In a survey of over 1,000 Americans about consumer hot sauce habits and preferences, we found Gen Z really stands out.  While 34% of Americans consider themselves “hot sauce connoisseurs,” over half (51%) of Gen Zers classify themselves as one. \n",
      "Five Reasons People Eat Hot Sauce \n",
      "Ninety-three percent of Americans eat hot sauce, but their tolerance varies. A bold 9% say they can eat anything as hot as possible, and 31% can handle hot flavors. Meanwhile, 33% say their limit is medium, while 20% can handle mild and nothing more. \n",
      "One generation is leading the charge when it comes to hot sauce: Gen Z. While 21% of Americans have been willing to sign a waiver to eat something with hot sauce, 35% of Gen Z have done the same. Their presence on social media could be a key driver. Over one in three (34%) Zoomers have tried a social media-inspired hot sauce challenge. \n",
      "One respondent called hot sauce her “entire life” saying: \n",
      "“I would eat hot sauce any day. It is a great conversation starter. I also really like Hot Ones and made my own Hot Ones challenge.”\n",
      "Over half (51%) of Americans use hot sauce more than once a week. People are drawn to hot sauce for five common reasons: \n",
      "Enjoy the taste\n",
      "Feel it adds depth to the dish\n",
      "Enjoy the sensation of heat\n",
      "Grew up eating hot or spicy foods\n",
      "Like to customize the heat level of their meals \n",
      "However, all this hot sauce comes with a physical price. Over two in three (68%) say it causes them to have a runny nose, and some end up sweating, crying, or even dealing with some digestive issues. But some Americans are hoping for that physical reaction when eating hot sauce. Nearly one in four – 23% – say they eat it just to clear their sinuses. \n",
      "“Swicy” Food and Drink Trend\n",
      "While sweet and spicy food isn’t a new concept, the word “swicy” is a new trendy term being used in marketing. Searches for the word on Google have increased 1,700% from March 2023 to March 2024 (the latest data available from Google at the time of this report), and three in four Americans say they would be willing to try swicy food or drinks. \n",
      "Although a bold 37% of Americans would try a taste of the hottest pepper in the world, younger generations have a greater desire to test their taste buds. Sixty percent of Gen Z and 47% of Millennials said they’d try a bite.\n",
      "Go-To Hot Sauces\n",
      "People are passionate about the hot sauces that they use. About one in four Millennials and Gen Z bring their own hot sauce to restaurants rather than run the risk of not having it for their meal. \n",
      "When it comes to buying hot sauce, 51% consider Scoville units before making a purchase. Scoville units are the measurement of how hot a pepper is rated. Over three in five (62%) are more likely to buy something if it’s advertised as hot or spicy. \n",
      "People mainly buy hot sauce from the grocery store, but 14% get it at local farmers markets. While the majority of Americans stick with traditional hot sauce brands, over one in 10 (12%) like to have artisanal hot sauces. Overall, the go-to hot sauce brands people prefer are: \n",
      "TABASCO® \n",
      "Frank’s RedHot®\n",
      "Cholula®\n",
      "Louisiana Hot Sauce\n",
      "Texas Pete® \n",
      "The majority of Americans prefer to douse hot sauce on tacos, chicken wings, or burritos. Around the U.S. though, certain regions put it on different foods. Those living in the South are more partial to putting hot sauce on seafood or soups and stews. In the Northeast, mac and cheese, fried rice, and hamburgers are more commonly eaten with hot sauce. Out West, people try hot sauce with their burritos and eggs. \n",
      "While one in 10 Americans who are over 21 prefer to sip something alcoholic while eating something with hot sauce, the majority prefer to drink something non-alcoholic. Most drink water followed by soda or milk. \n",
      "Top 5 Favorite Cuisines Known for Their Spice\n",
      "Hot sauce culture drives a desire for spice that extends outside of sauce. Americans enjoy a variety of spicy foods from around the world with three in four consumers specifically enjoying cuisines known for their spice. The top cuisines Americans enjoy include Mexican, Chinese/Szechuan, Spanish, Thai and Indian. \n",
      "The places where people live and grow up can strongly influence their hot sauce habits. In fact, 19% of those living in the South and 18% of those in the West say they eat hot sauce with their food because they live in a place with a lot of hot and spicy food.\n",
      "While one in three attribute their high tolerance for hot sauce to their hometowns or places they currently live, 27% credit cultural or social influences for their tolerance. More than half of Asian and Hispanic survey respondents say cultural or social influences have made eating hot sauce easier. \n",
      "One respondent shared his grandmother was Sicilian and that she loved eating hot sauce, so he does too. Another respondent had this to say:\n",
      "“It pairs really well with soda, in my opinion, and it is a part of a lot of my culture’s traditional foods. It’s just really delicious.” \n",
      "Nearly one in 10 (9%) prefer to make hot sauce themselves. Slightly more Hispanic and Asian respondents shared they make homemade hot sauce than the average American. \n",
      "Reasons People Don’t Eat Hot Sauce\n",
      "Hot sauce isn’t for everyone. There are five main reasons people don’t eat hot sauce:\n",
      "Don’t like spicy food\n",
      "Don’t like the burning feeling\n",
      "Digestive sensitivities \n",
      "Low spice tolerance\n",
      "Didn’t grow up eating hot/spicy food. \n",
      "While most Americans still choose hot sauce as their number one condiment, the other top condiment is ketchup. Among all the generations, baby boomers were the only ones to choose ketchup as their top condiment over hot sauce. More women than men also prefer ketchup to hot sauce.\n",
      "According to NCSolutions purchase data, in the first three months of 2024, mayonnaise was the top condiment purchased by consumers. Hot sauce/chili condiments were the second most popular purchase followed by ketchup, mustard, and soy sauce. Interestingly, the end of the year appears to be a more popular time for hot sauce purchases. In 2023, the biggest months for buying hot sauce were December, October, and November.\n",
      "At the end of the day, everyone needs a little spice in their life. At least, that’s what one survey respondent said when we asked them why they like hot sauce. Whether you prefer to spice up your life by eating something with hot sauce or maybe just eating something new, we hope you continually find new flavorful food and drinks.\n",
      "About the Consumer Sentiment Survey\n",
      "The consumer sentiment survey of 1,114 Americans was commissioned by NCSolutions in April and May 2024 and was made up of U.S. adults ages 18+, who were asked about their eating habits and preferences. Results were weighted to be representative of the U.S. population by age, gender, region, ethnicity, marital status, education level, and household income.\n",
      "About the NCS Purchase Data\n",
      "NCS provides purchase insights to brands to help them optimize, measure, and enable sales-based outcomes.NCS’s representative and balanced consumer CPG purchase data set consists of the industry’s preeminent and comprehensive sources.

      "The 14-page report, which you can download here, includes overviews of all the key trends of note, but in this post, we’ll take a look at some of the highlights.\n",
      "For this year’s Creative Trends Report, YouTube has identified four major subtopics of note:\n",
      "Widespread online personalization – New creative tools and formats have increased viewer expectations around experiences that are more customized to their interests.\n",
      "Mainstream casual creativity – Along the same line, viewers are also adopting different levels of engagement, and creators should be working to invite variable fan experiences. \n",
      "Content experiences built for viewers – Creators should also be looking to diversify their outputs to meet different audience demands, like podcasts, Shorts, live, etc.\n",
      "AI-enabled creative possibility – New creative tools enable new levels of audience participation, which also provide new opportunities for creators to spark trends.\n",
      "Each of these trends has its own highlight section in the report, which looks at how audiences are adapting to each, and how creators are building these new elements into their content.\n",
      "There are some valuable insights and notes here, which could get you thinking on how you can incorporate these trends and shifts into your content approach, and what types of engagement you should be aiming to evoke with your uploads.\n",
      "YouTube has also published a ‘guided tour’ of the report with creator Airrack, providing another way to interpret the data.\n",
      "While it’s also published a new interview with Kevin Allocca, its Head of Culture and Trends.\n",
      "There are some valuable insights here, and if you’re looking to get a better handle on key creative shifts, on YouTube and more broadly, it’s worth tuning in and seeing what you can take away from these data-backed notes. \n",

      "Hot Sauce Market Trends: How Gen Z is Redefining Hot Sauce Culture\n",
      "Hot sauce can be a polarizing topic: some can’t eat it while others can’t go without it – to the point where they even bring it to restaurants. Among hot sauce enthusiasts, this topping is more than a condiment, it’s a culture. \n",
      "As Americans make homemade hot sauce, test the limits of their taste buds, and try artisanal hot sauce, one generation seems to be fueling this trend: Gen Z. In a survey of over 1,000 Americans about consumer hot sauce habits and preferences, we found Gen Z really stands out.  While 34% of Americans consider themselves “hot sauce connoisseurs,” over half (51%) of Gen Zers classify themselves as one. \n",
      "Five Reasons People Eat Hot Sauce \n",
      "Ninety-three percent of Americans eat hot sauce, but their tolerance varies. A bold 9% say they can eat anything as hot as possible, and 31% can handle hot flavors. Meanwhile, 33% say their limit is medium, while 20% can handle mild and nothing more. \n",
      "One generation is leading the charge when it comes to hot sauce: Gen Z. While 21% of Americans have been willing to sign a waiver to eat something with hot sauce, 35% of Gen Z have done the same. Their presence on social media could be a key driver. Over one in three (34%) Zoomers have tried a social media-inspired hot sauce challenge. \n",
      "One respondent called hot sauce her “entire life” saying: \n",
      "“I would eat hot sauce any day. It is a great conversation starter. I also really like Hot Ones and made my own Hot Ones challenge.”\n",
      "Over half (51%) of Americans use hot sauce more than once a week. People are drawn to hot sauce for five common reasons: \n",
      "Enjoy the taste\n",
      "Feel it adds depth to the dish\n",
      "Enjoy the sensation of heat\n",
      "Grew up eating hot or spicy foods\n",
      "Like to customize the heat level of their meals \n",
      "However, all this hot sauce comes with a physical price. Over two in three (68%) say it causes them to have a runny nose, and some end up sweating, crying, or even dealing with some digestive issues. But some Americans are hoping for that physical reaction when eating hot sauce. Nearly one in four – 23% – say they eat it just to clear their sinuses. \n",
      "“Swicy” Food and Drink Trend\n",
      "While sweet and spicy food isn’t a new concept, the word “swicy” is a new trendy term being used in marketing. Searches for the word on Google have increased 1,700% from March 2023 to March 2024 (the latest data available from Google at the time of this report), and three in four Americans say they would be willing to try swicy food or drinks. \n",
      "Although a bold 37% of Americans would try a taste of the hottest pepper in the world, younger generations have a greater desire to test their taste buds. Sixty percent of Gen Z and 47% of Millennials said they’d try a bite.\n",
      "Go-To Hot Sauces\n",
      "People are passionate about the hot sauces that they use. About one in four Millennials and Gen Z bring their own hot sauce to restaurants rather than run the risk of not having it for their meal. \n",
      "When it comes to buying hot sauce, 51% consider Scoville units before making a purchase. Scoville units are the measurement of how hot a pepper is rated. Over three in five (62%) are more likely to buy something if it’s advertised as hot or spicy. \n",
      "People mainly buy hot sauce from the grocery store, but 14% get it at local farmers markets. While the majority of Americans stick with traditional hot sauce brands, over one in 10 (12%) like to have artisanal hot sauces. Overall, the go-to hot sauce brands people prefer are: \n",
      "TABASCO® \n",
      "Frank’s RedHot®\n",
      "Cholula®\n",
      "Louisiana Hot Sauce\n",
      "Texas Pete® \n",
      "The majority of Americans prefer to douse hot sauce on tacos, chicken wings, or burritos. Around the U.S. though, certain regions put it on different foods. Those living in the South are more partial to putting hot sauce on seafood or soups and stews. In the Northeast, mac and cheese, fried rice, and hamburgers are more commonly eaten with hot sauce. Out West, people try hot sauce with their burritos and eggs. \n",
      "While one in 10 Americans who are over 21 prefer to sip something alcoholic while eating something with hot sauce, the majority prefer to drink something non-alcoholic. Most drink water followed by soda or milk. \n",
      "Top 5 Favorite Cuisines Known for Their Spice\n",
      "Hot sauce culture drives a desire for spice that extends outside of sauce. Americans enjoy a variety of spicy foods from around the world with three in four consumers specifically enjoying cuisines known for their spice. The top cuisines Americans enjoy include Mexican, Chinese/Szechuan, Spanish, Thai and Indian. \n",
      "The places where people live and grow up can strongly influence their hot sauce habits. In fact, 19% of those living in the South and 18% of those in the West say they eat hot sauce with their food because they live in a place with a lot of hot and spicy food.\n",
      "While one in three attribute their high tolerance for hot sauce to their hometowns or places they currently live, 27% credit cultural or social influences for their tolerance. More than half of Asian and Hispanic survey respondents say cultural or social influences have made eating hot sauce easier. \n",
      "One respondent shared his grandmother was Sicilian and that she loved eating hot sauce, so he does too. Another respondent had this to say:\n",
      "“It pairs really well with soda, in my opinion, and it is a part of a lot of my culture’s traditional foods. It’s just really delicious.” \n",
      "Nearly one in 10 (9%) prefer to make hot sauce themselves. Slightly more Hispanic and Asian respondents shared they make homemade hot sauce than the average American. \n",
      "Reasons People Don’t Eat Hot Sauce\n",
      "Hot sauce isn’t for everyone. There are five main reasons people don’t eat hot sauce:\n",
      "Don’t like spicy food\n",
      "Don’t like the burning feeling\n",
      "Digestive sensitivities \n",
      "Low spice tolerance\n",
      "Didn’t grow up eating hot/spicy food. \n",
      "While most Americans still choose hot sauce as their number one condiment, the other top condiment is ketchup. Among all the generations, baby boomers were the only ones to choose ketchup as their top condiment over hot sauce. More women than men also prefer ketchup to hot sauce.\n",
      "According to NCSolutions purchase data, in the first three months of 2024, mayonnaise was the top condiment purchased by consumers. Hot sauce/chili condiments were the second most popular purchase followed by ketchup, mustard, and soy sauce. Interestingly, the end of the year appears to be a more popular time for hot sauce purchases. In 2023, the biggest months for buying hot sauce were December, October, and November.\n",
      "At the end of the day, everyone needs a little spice in their life. At least, that’s what one survey respondent said when we asked them why they like hot sauce. Whether you prefer to spice up your life by eating something with hot sauce or maybe just eating something new, we hope you continually find new flavorful food and drinks.\n",
      "About the Consumer Sentiment Survey\n",
      "The consumer sentiment survey of 1,114 Americans was commissioned by NCSolutions in April and May 2024 and was made up of U.S. adults ages 18+, who were asked about their eating habits and preferences. Results were weighted to be representative of the U.S. population by age, gender, region, ethnicity, marital status, education level, and household income.\n",
      "About the NCS Purchase Data\n",
      "NCS provides purchase insights to brands to help them optimize, measure, and enable sales-based outcomes.NCS’s representative and balanced consumer CPG purchase data set consists of the industry’s preeminent and comprehensive sources. It is inclusive of actual purchase data (transaction information) from big-box retailers, supermarkets, drug stores, convenience stores and other retail channels through which American households buy CPG products spanning 340+ grocery categories.

      "1. **Swicy Trend - Top 5 Sweet and Spicy Hot Sauces**:\n",
      "    - The \"Swicy\" trend, which combines sweet and spicy flavors, is highly popular. Articles from sources like The Food Institute, The News Virginian, and WVTM 13 highlight the rise of swicy flavors in various foods, including hot sauces. This trend is also popular on platforms like TikTok and YouTube. Videos such as \"Sweet and Spicy Hot Sauce Taste Test\" on YouTube indicate significant viewer interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **International Flavors - Hot Sauces Around the World**:\n",
      "    - The concept of exploring international flavors in hot sauces has substantial interest. Videos like \"12 Hot Sauce from Around the World\" and \"Top Hot Sauces for the 2023 Culinary Landscape\" on YouTube show that viewers are keen on discovering diverse hot sauces from different cultures. This aligns with the growing popularity of ethnic cuisines in the U.S. market, as highlighted by sources like Cascadia Food & Beverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Hot Ones Challenge - Local Influencers Edition**:\n",
      "    - The \"Hot Ones Challenge\" format is immensely popular, as evidenced by the success of the \"Hot Ones\" series on YouTube. Multiple videos featuring celebrities and local influencers participating in this challenge have garnered millions of views. This format's engaging nature and the involvement of influencers make it a strong contender for virality.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Artisanal Hot Sauces - A Day in the Life of a Hot Sauce Maker**:\n",
      "    - There is reasonable interest in artisanal hot sauces and the stories behind their makers. Videos and articles like \"Colorado hot sauce makers are on fire\" and \"Vermont's Butterfly Bakery spices up new season of hit show 'Hot Ones'\" suggest that viewers appreciate the craftsmanship and unique stories of local hot sauce producers. However, this theme might not have as broad an appeal as the previously mentioned ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Functional Benefits - Health Benefits of Hot Sauces**:\n",
      "    - The health benefits of hot sauces, particularly those containing capsaicin, are well-documented and of interest to health-conscious consumers. Videos like \"Sean Evans Explains the Health Benefits of Hot Sauce\" and \"Hot Sauce and Capsaicin: The Surprising Therapeutic Benefits\" on YouTube indicate that there is a niche but dedicated audience for this topic. This trend is bolstered by the growing demand for functional foods and beverages with added health benefits.\n",

      "Hot Ones is an American YouTube talk show, created by Chris Schonberger, hosted by Sean Evans and produced by First We Feast and Complex Media.[1] Its basic premise involves celebrities being interviewed by Evans over a platter of increasingly spicy chicken wings. Several spin-offs have been produced, including the game show Hot Ones: The Game Show on the cable television network TruTV, and Truth or Dab, a truth or dare style competition that also airs on the First We Feast YouTube channel.\n",
      "As of April 2024, the show has produced twenty-three seasons (with three seasons per calendar year since 2018). Most seasons produce between 10 and 16 episodes, though prior to 2018 there were longer seasons consisting of more episodes; approximately 40 episodes air per year. Each season features a different line-up of hot sauces, though certain sauces remain from year-to-year, including three self-produced sauces, \"Hot Ones – The Classic\" in spot 1, \"Hot Ones – Los Calientes\" in either spot 4 or 5, and \"Hot Ones – The Last Dab\" as the final sauce. Since Season 2, \"Da' Bomb Beyond Insanity\" has occupied spot 8. Guests who do not complete the gauntlet of hot sauces are placed in the \"Hall of Shame\" or, beginning in Season 17, the \"Wall-Most Made it.\"\n",
      "The show has been nominated for several awards, winning two Streamy Awards and its host, Sean Evans, has been nominated for Daytime Emmy Award. In 2022, Hot Ones received a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Entertainment. The show has been noted for its deep-probing questions, often digging up material from a celebrity's background not often discussed on other interview shows, with Hollywood Insider calling it \"the hottest celebrity interview right now\" in 2021.[2]\n",
      "Format[edit]\n",
      "The format involves Evans and his celebrity guests eating ten chicken wings (or a vegetarian/vegan alternative based on the guest's preference), each prepared with a progressively hotter hot sauce. Evans states the show's tagline at the beginning of each episode: \"The show with hot questions, and even hotter wings.\"\n",
      "The first sauce presented is relatively mild such as sriracha, which has a rating of 2,200 Scoville units. The final sauce (as of season 4), Hot Ones' own The Last Dab (The Last Dab Reduxx starting in season 6, The Last Dab XXX starting in Season 10, The Last Dab Apollo starting in season 13, and The Last Dab Xperience starting in season 22), has a Scoville rating of 2,000,000+.[3] As per \"tradition\", the guests are encouraged to put a minuscule extra amount of The Last Dab on the final wing; they are told this is not required, but most guests opt to do so even when already struggling with the heat of the previous wings.\n",
      "After each wing, Evans asks his guest an interview question. As the wings get hotter, the questions often become more challenging,[further explanation needed] and the guest typically begins to display the effects of eating the spicier wings and the interview becomes less focused on the guest and more so the struggle to finish the wings. The guests are also provided glasses of water and milk as well as ice cream to counteract the effect of the wings.\n",
      "The standard show is Evans and one guest eating ten wings each, but in some episodes where there are two guests (such as the episodes featuring Keegan-Michael Key & Jordan Peele and Hila & Ethan Klein from h3h3Productions), only five wings are given to each guest. Guests are allowed to promote their upcoming projects. Guests who fail to finish all ten wings are added to the show's Hall of Shame.\n",
      "Development[edit]\n",
      "The show was created by First We Feast Founder Christopher Schonberger. Schonberger cites Alexa Chung's quirky interview show Popworld as the inspiration for the show.[4] The show is hosted by Sean Evans.\n",
      "On September 26, 2017, First We Feast featured an episode of Sean in the Wild, using sauces from Hot Ones, starring Sean Evans and Michael Stevens from Vsauce.[5]\n",
      "The nineteenth episode of the fourth season featuring Mario Batali was originally released on November 23, 2017 and was removed a month later possibly in light of the sexual misconduct allegations towards him.[6][7]\n",

      "On February 18, 2020, a spin-off titled Hot Ones: The Game Show premiered on truTV. Hosted by Evans, the series pits two pairs of players against one another for a chance to win up to $25,000. The main game is played in three rounds, using wings that have been cooked in hot sauces whose Scoville ratings increase from one round to the next. Players are not provided with any water or milk to reduce the effects of the wings but are given buckets in which to vomit if necessary.[8]\n",
      "In each of the first two rounds, the players begin by eating one wing apiece and the host asks three toss-up questions open to all. The first team to buzz in has five seconds to respond; a correct answer awards them money, while a miss gives it to the opposing team. Questions are worth $100/$200/$300 in the first round, and these values double to $200/$400/$600 for the second.\n",
      "In the third round, the players begin by eating one bite of a wing. The host reads a series of clues, and players may buzz in at any time to identify the subject being described. Three puzzles are played, worth $1,000/$2,000/$3,000; the team that scores on each puzzle must then take another bite. In this round, if a team misses, the opponents must give the correct answer in order to score. Both teams keep their accumulated winnings.\n",
      "The higher-scoring team advances to the \"Ring of Fire\" bonus round, in which each member must drink a shot of mixed hot sauce at the outset that includes a sauce with a Scoville rating of 2 million. One member is then shown a series of words and must get their partner to guess each one by describing it. The clue-giver may pass on a word at any time. If the team can solve five words in 60 seconds, their winnings are increased to $25,000 and they are given large milkshakes to relieve the effects of the sauce and wings they have eaten.\n",
      "Hot Ones Hot Pockets[edit]\n",
      "In August 2023, food brand Hot Pockets announced that it was teaming up with Hot Ones to release four varieties of Hot Pockets with the Hot Ones brand. Three of these products are sold wherever Hot Pockets are available, while one is exclusively sold through Gopuff.[9]\n",
